UniScan is a web-based tool that analyzes any input text and provides a detailed breakdown of each character's encoding properties. It helps developers, writers, and QA engineers detect hidden, non-ASCII, or special Unicode characters â€” making it an essential utility for content validation, debugging, and localization tasks.
